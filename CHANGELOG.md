# Changes from elasticsearch-transport:

## 7.14

 - Fixes for Manticore Implementation: Addresses custom headers on initialization (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/commit/3732dd4f6de75365460fa99c1cd89668b107ef1c) and fixes tracing (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/commit/3c48ebd9a783988d1f71bfb9940459832ccd63e4). Related to #1426 and #1428.

## 7.13

- Fixes thread safety issue in `get_connection` - [Pull Request](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/pull/1325).

## 7.12

- Ruby 3 is now tested, it was added to the entire test suite.

## 7.11

- Fixes a bug with headers in our default Faraday class. [Commit](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/commit/9c4afc452467cc6344359b54b98bbe5af1469219).

## 7.10

- Use 443 for default cloud port, 9200 as the default port for http
- Fixes a bug when building the complete endpoint URL could end with duplicate slashes `//`.
- Fixes a bug when building the complete endpoint URL with cloud id could end with duplicate ports [#1081](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/issues/1081).

## 7.9
- Transport/Connection: Considers attributes values for equality - [Commit](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/commit/06ffd03bf51f5f33a0d87e9914e66b39357d40af).
- When an API endpoint accepts both `GET` and `POST`, the client will always use `POST` when a request body is present.

## 7.8
- Surface deprecation headers from Elasticsearch. When there's a `warning` response header in Elasticsearch's response, the client will emit a warning with `warn`.
- Typhoeus is supported again, version 1.4+ and has been added back to the docs.
- Adds documentation and example for integrating with Elastic APM.

## 7.7

- Drops support for Ruby 2.4 since it's reached it's end of life.

## 7.6

### Faraday migrated to 1.0

We're now using version 1.0 of Faraday:
- The client initializer was modified but this should not disrupt final users at all, check [this commit](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/commit/0fdc6533f4621a549a4cb99e778bbd827461a2d0) for more information.
- Migrated error checking to remove the deprecated `Faraday::Error` namespace.
- **This change is not compatible with [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus)**. The latest release is 1.3.1, but it's [still using the deprecated `Faraday::Error` namespace](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus/blob/v1.3.1/lib/typhoeus/adapters/faraday.rb#L100). This has been fixed on master, but the last release was November 6, 2018. Version 1.4.0 should be ok once it's released.
- Note: Faraday 1.0 drops official support for JRuby. It installs fine on the tests we run with JRuby in this repo, but it's something we should pay attention to.
